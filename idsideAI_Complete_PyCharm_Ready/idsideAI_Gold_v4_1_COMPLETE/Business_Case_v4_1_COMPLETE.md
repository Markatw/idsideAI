# idsideAI Business Case v4.1 — Decision Model Edition

## Opening Narrative: The AI Decision Crisis

Sarah, a marketing director at a mid-sized consultancy, starts her day juggling ChatGPT for content creation, Claude for analysis, and Gemini for research. Each interaction is isolated. When her colleague asks how she made a critical campaign decision last month, she can't recreate the logic. When her team needs to make similar decisions, they start from scratch every time.

This is the AI Decision Crisis: powerful tools, fragmented experiences, lost institutional knowledge.

**idsideAI solves this by becoming the Decision Layer for AI — orchestrating models, boosting outcomes, and turning every ask into a reusable Decision Model.**
