## Demo Script (15-20 minutes)

### Opening (2 minutes)

**"Welcome everyone. Today I'm going to show you how idsideAI transforms the way we make AI-assisted decisions. Instead of having fragmented conversations across multiple AI tools, we're going to create a reusable Decision Model that captures our entire decision-making process."**

**"Let's tackle a real business decision: Should our startup hire a senior marketing manager? This is the kind of complex decision that involves multiple factors, stakeholder input, and long-term implications."**

### Step 1: Starting the Decision (3 minutes)

**Action:** Click "New Decision" button

**"First, I'll create a new decision in idsideAI. Notice how clean and intuitive the interface is."**

**Action:** Type the decision title: "Hire Senior Marketing Manager?"

**"I'm starting with a clear decision statement. idsideAI automatically creates our first Decision node."**

**Action:** Point to the blue hexagon that appears

**"This blue hexagon represents our core decision. Now let's explore our options."**

### Step 2: AI Orchestration (4 minutes)

**Action:** Click "Ask AI" and type: "What are the pros and cons of hiring a senior marketing manager for a Series A startup with £2M ARR?"

**"Watch what happens when I ask this question. idsideAI is orchestrating multiple AI models behind the scenes."**

**Action:** Show the AI provider selection and response

**"Notice how idsideAI chose GPT-4 for this strategic question, but I could override that choice. The response is being automatically structured into our Decision Graph."**

**Action:** Point to new nodes appearing

**"See how the AI's response is being broken down into Option nodes - the blue rounded rectangles. We're getting 'Hire Now' and 'Wait 6 Months' as our main options."**

### Step 3: Building the Decision Graph (5 minutes)

**Action:** Click on "Hire Now" option to expand

**"Let me dive deeper into the 'Hire Now' option. I'll ask for specific evidence."**

**Action:** Type: "What evidence supports hiring a marketing manager now? Include specific metrics and benchmarks."

**"Watch as idsideAI creates Evidence nodes - these green circles with confidence rings."**

**Action:** Point to evidence nodes appearing

**"Each piece of evidence gets a confidence score. This one shows '75% confidence' based on industry benchmarks. The sources are automatically captured for audit purposes."**

**Action:** Add a risk assessment

**"Now let's identify risks. I'll ask: 'What are the main risks of hiring a senior marketing manager right now?'"**

**Action:** Show risk nodes appearing in amber

**"These amber oval nodes represent risks with severity indicators. 'Budget strain' is marked as 'High severity' while 'Cultural fit' is 'Medium severity.'"**

### Step 4: Collaborative Features (3 minutes)

**Action:** Click "Invite Collaborators"

**"In a real scenario, I'd invite our CEO, CTO, and Head of Sales to collaborate on this decision. They can add their own evidence, comment on options, and contribute to the decision-making process."**

**Action:** Show comment feature

**"Team members can leave comments on any node. Here's where our Head of Sales might add: 'We need marketing support for the enterprise push.'"**

**Action:** Demonstrate real-time updates

**"All changes happen in real-time. Everyone sees the decision evolve as we build consensus."**

### Step 5: Decision Model Creation (2 minutes)

**Action:** Click "Save as Decision Model"

**"Now comes the magic. I'm saving this entire decision process as a reusable Decision Model."**

**Action:** Add title and tags

**"I'll call it 'Startup Hiring Decision Framework' and tag it with 'hiring,' 'marketing,' and 'growth.'"**

**Action:** Set sharing permissions

**"I can keep this private, share with my team, or make it public for other startups to learn from."**

### Step 6: The Power of Reuse (2 minutes)

**Action:** Navigate to Decision Model library

**"Here's my Decision Model library. Next time we need to make a similar hiring decision - maybe for a sales manager or engineer - I can reuse this framework."**

**Action:** Click "Use Template" on the saved model

**"Watch how the entire decision structure is recreated, but I can modify the inputs for the new role. The logic is preserved, but the content is fresh."**

### Step 7: Enterprise Features (2 minutes)

**Action:** Click "Why Export"

**"For compliance and documentation, idsideAI can generate a narrative explanation of our decision."**

**Action:** Show generated PDF

**"This creates an audit-ready document that explains our reasoning, includes all evidence sources, and shows how we reached our conclusion. Perfect for board meetings or regulatory requirements."**

**Action:** Show Compare mode

**"We can also compare different versions of our decision to see how our thinking evolved over time."**

## Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "How does this compare to just using ChatGPT directly?"**
**A:** "ChatGPT gives you one conversation that disappears. idsideAI captures the decision logic, makes it reusable, enables team collaboration, and provides audit trails. It's the difference between a single conversation and institutional knowledge."

**Q: "What if the AI makes wrong recommendations?"**
**A:** "idsideAI doesn't make decisions for you - it helps you structure your decision-making process. You control the logic, evaluate the evidence, and make the final choice. The AI provides information and analysis, but human judgment drives the decision."

**Q: "How secure is our decision data?"**
**A:** "Enterprise-grade security with encryption at rest and in transit. Your decision data stays private unless you choose to share it. We're SOC 2 compliant and working toward additional certifications."

**Q: "Can this integrate with our existing tools?"**
**A:** "Yes, we have APIs for integration with popular business tools. We can also export Decision Models to various formats for use in other systems."

**Q: "What's the learning curve for our team?"**
**A:** "Most users are productive within 30 minutes. The interface is intuitive, and we provide comprehensive onboarding. Teams typically see value from day one."
