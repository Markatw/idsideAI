# IDECIDE AI — Maths Logic Report
*Aligned with Master Green App 040925 (ABSOLUTE GREEN certified baseline)*

---

## 1. Purpose
This report documents the mathematical and logical underpinnings of IDECIDE AI’s orchestration engine, performance benchmarking, and pricing models. It ensures full transparency for Board, investors, and technical stakeholders.

---

## 2. Decision Graphs Logic
- **Structure**: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) model representing multi-step AI reasoning.  
- **Node Types**: Input, processing, validation, output.  
- **Pathfinding**: Weighted edge costs based on performance metrics.  
- **Execution**: Graph traversal determines the optimal sequence of providers and transformations.  

Mathematical core:  
- Let G = (V, E) where V = nodes, E = edges.  
- Edge weights w(e) represent latency, confidence, and cost.  
- Path P* = argmin Σ w(e) across all candidate paths.  
- Outputs validated at terminal nodes via quality scoring function Q(o).  

---

## 3. Quality Scoring
Quality function Q(o) is defined as:  
Q(o) = α * Accuracy + β * Relevance + γ * Efficiency  

Where:  
- α, β, γ are adjustable weights per workspace context.  
- Q(o) ∈ [0, 1].  
- Threshold τ = 0.8 for ABSOLUTE GREEN outputs.  

---

## 4. Turbo Analytics
Turbo introduces performance dashboards powered by real-time metrics.  
- **Confidence Index (CI)** = mean(Q(o)) across outputs.  
- **Failure Rate (FR)** = (# of retries) / (total requests).  
- **Efficiency Ratio (ER)** = outputs/time.  

Target values:  
- CI ≥ 0.85  
- FR ≤ 5%  
- ER ≥ 1.2 outputs/sec

## 5. Pricing Model
Referral-based, low-cost pricing designed to maximise adoption while maintaining sustainability.  

Mathematical model:  
- Base subscription: £X.  
- Referral discount per paying referral: d%.  
- Discount cap: c = 80%.  
- Effective price P = max(0.2X, X * (1 – n * d%)), where n = number of paying referrals.  

Example:  
- X = £10/month, d = 10%, n = 5 → P = £2 (floor at 20%).  

---

## 6. Growth Projections
Year 1 (Base scenario):  
- 75,000 users.  
- ARR ≈ £2.85m.  

Year 2 (Base scenario):  
- ARR ≈ £6–7m.  

Retention modelling:  
- Churn < 5%.  
- Viral coefficient K ≥ 0.20.  

---

## 7. Risk Modelling
- **Referral Fraud Probability**: p ≈ 2% (detectable via anomaly detection).  
- **API Dependency Risk**: Mitigated by multi-provider redundancy.  
- **Competitive Undercut**: Addressed by maintaining floor pricing (20%).  

---

## 8. Conclusion
The mathematical and logical design of IDECIDE AI ensures a scalable, ethical, and disruption-proof system.  
- Decision Graphs formalise orchestration.  
- Turbo metrics quantify quality and efficiency.  
- Referral economics guarantee affordability.
